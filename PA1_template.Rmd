## Loading and preprocessing the data

Unzip data to obtain the csv file

``` {r}
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'), method = "curl")
unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",exdir = "data")
```

Reading .csv data into data.table

``` {r}
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculating the total number of steps taken per day

``` {r}
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 
head(Total_Steps, 10)
```

Making a histogram of the total steps taken per day

``` {r}
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "red", binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```
Calculating the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

``` {r}
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Making a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

``` {r}
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 

ggplot(IntervalDT, aes(x = interval , y = steps)) + geom_line(color="red", size=1) + labs(title = "Average Daily Steps", x = "Interval", y = "Avgerage Steps per day")
```

Selecting the interval across all the days in the dataset, containing the maximum number of steps

``` {r}
IntervalDT[steps == max(steps), .(max_interval = interval)]
```


## Imputing missing values

Calculating the total number of missing values in the dataset

``` {r}
activityDT[is.na(steps),]
```

Filling in the missing values with the median of the dataset

```{r}
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
```

Creating a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in

``` {r}
data.table::fwrite(x = activityDT, file = "data/tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)
```

Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculating the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

``` {r}
# total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

# mean and median total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps), Median_Steps = median(steps))]
```

``` {r}
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "red", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Creating a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day

``` {r}
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
activityDT[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
activityDT[, `Day of Week`:= weekdays(x = date)]
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Montag|Dienstag|Mittwoch|Donnerstag|Freitag", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekday"
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Samstag|Sonntag", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
activityDT[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
head(activityDT, 10)
```

Making a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

``` {r}
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, `weekday or weekend`)] 

ggplot(IntervalDT , aes(x = interval , y = steps, color = `weekday or weekend`)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps by Weektype", x = "Interval", y = "No. of Steps") + facet_wrap(~`weekday or weekend` , ncol = 1, nrow=2)
```
